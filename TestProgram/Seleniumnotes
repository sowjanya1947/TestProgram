 Locators in webElements
 // id is unique value -1
 ID - By.id("value")
 // name  is unique value -1
 Name -By.name("value")
 
 //only for links all links are represented by a tag <a /a>
 Link Text - By.linktext("linktext") -4
 // not recommended if you have link text very lengthy then use this locator.
 Partial Link Text -by.partiallinktext("mention partial part text")  -5
 Tag Name -
 // class name is having duplicates the designer will give same class for different button 
 Class Name - By.classname("class value") -4
 CSS Selector - By.cssselector("#id value") -3
 XPATH - //tagname[@attributeid ='Attributevalue'] -2 
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dynamic xpath:
 
 When id,name value not given and in some cases they are giving absoluate xpath then we use dynamic xpath.
 
 Syntax:
 
 //input[@class='value']
 //input[@name='value']
 //input[contains(@class,'value')]
 
 Dynamic id :input
 id = test_123
 By.id("test_123)
 //input[contains(@id,'test_')]
 
starts-with 
id = test_456
id=test_888
id=test_test_123

//input[starts-with(@id,'test_')]

ends-with
id=123_test_t
id=145_test_t
id=12367_test_t

//input[ends-with(@id,'_test_t)

Dynamic xpath for linktext - text() is a function

//a[contains(text(),'Google Search'].click();

//absoluate xpath is not recommented

//performance is slow
//not reliable
//can be change at any time in future
